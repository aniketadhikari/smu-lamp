# Decision Support Systems Team Project

# About SMU Case
Build a web application which will allow students working in team project to do intra-team peer evaluation. This evaluation will be based on a set of rubric. Sample rubrics can be found at: Canvas > Files > TEAM PROJECT > CLIENT ORGANIZATIONS > 1. Singapore Management University >   These rubrics can be then mapped to the SMU Graduate Learning Outcomes. For each student these peer evaluation will be consolidated across many courses and the student can then see a visual dashboard of the consolidated achievement in terms of the SMU Graduate Learning Outcomes (achieved, working towards, needs improvement, etc.).  This project will require a web front end, database and visual APIs for the dashboard.  Your application should:
* allow the professor to import students and courses (DONE)
* allow the professor to create student groups (DONE)
* allow the professor to schedule peer evaluations (DONE)
* allow the student to complete peer evaluations (DONE)
* provide operational reporting, for all of the above

Note that your project should be customized to Singapore Management Universityâ€™s needs: consult the smu.edu.sg website for information on SMU branding, SMU courses, SMU semesters, etc.  Projects that include only VT branding, VT courses, VT semesters, etc. will lose points.
