# Decision Support Systems Team Project
Analysis, design, and implementation of a complete web-based software system using an Agile software development process. Apart of the BIT 4454 (Business Analysis Seminar in IT) class for Professor Alan Abrahams. 

The development process for this project will include:

### Stand Ups
Must be submitted every alternate Monday morning during the team project, via Assignments on Canvas.  Standup submissions must be received before Monday midnight on Standup days during the team project.  Points will be deducted for that week if your Standup Workbook is not submitted via Assignments on Canvas by Monday midnight, every other Monday during the team project.
### Sprint Retrospectives
Each Thursday during the team project, teams will be able to receive informal, interactive feedback on their current Sprint work-in-progress.  Teams must submit (as a group) a Sprint Retrospective Workbook for the current Sprint (1, 2, or 3) and current phase (Design or Implementation), each Thursday during the team project.  Please use the same workbook throughout the semester, so your cumulative progress is visible.  Role Design and Role Implementation rubrics for all roles, complete up to the current sprint and phase, must be submitted with the Retrospective workbook, as evidence of completion of your tasks.   The Sprint Retrospective workbook should be completed by the Project Manager for your team.  If you dispute your project manager’s evaluation of your effort and accomplishments, submit your version of the Sprint Retrospective workbook separately. 
### Sprint Demos
Complete formal Sprint Demo’s must be presented via recorded video, every alternate Friday during the team project: one video per team. Every team member should participate in the video demo (Participation points will be deducted for non-participation).  Submit your Product Backlog and PowerPoint slides with your video presentation, via Assignments > Sprint X: Video Demo on Canvas. Demos must include:
  * Filled in Product Backlog workbook (updated to reflect progress to date, and plans)
  *	PowerPoint slides 
  * Demo video for the current sprint

# About SMU Case
Build a web application which will allow students working in team project to do intra-team peer evaluation. This evaluation will be based on a set of rubric. Sample rubrics can be found at: Canvas > Files > TEAM PROJECT > CLIENT ORGANIZATIONS > 1. Singapore Management University >   These rubrics can be then mapped to the SMU Graduate Learning Outcomes. For each student these peer evaluation will be consolidated across many courses and the student can then see a visual dashboard of the consolidated achievement in terms of the SMU Graduate Learning Outcomes (achieved, working towards, needs improvement, etc.).  This project will require a web front end, database and visual APIs for the dashboard.  Your application should:
* allow the professor to import students and courses (DONE)
* allow the professor to create student groups (DONE)
* allow the professor to schedule peer evaluations (DONE)
* allow the student to complete peer evaluations
* provide operational reporting, for all of the above

Note that your project should be customized to Singapore Management University’s needs: consult the smu.edu.sg website for information on SMU branding, SMU courses, SMU semesters, etc.  Projects that include only VT branding, VT courses, VT semesters, etc. will lose points.
